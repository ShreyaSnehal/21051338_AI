Genetic Algorithm for Image Generation

This repository contains code that uses a Genetic Algorithm (GA) that takes an image as its input and generates the same image using N number of squares. The GA evolves a population of squares to approximate a target image.

#Prerequisites

Before running the code, these libraries should be installed on your system:

-Python
- Required Python packages (install them using pip):
  - Numpy
  - PIL(Python Imaging Library)
  - random
  - requests
  - IPython.display

## Getting Started

These are the steps to run the code:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
2. Create a Google Drive folder and upload your target image. Make sure the image is publicly accessible.
3. Either download the file or copy paste the code in a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).
4. Update the input_image_link variable with the link to your target image on Google Drive.
5. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project folder.
6. Run the Python script.
7. The code will generate an image using the Genetic Algorithm and display the result.
